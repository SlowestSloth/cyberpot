## Introduction
### Goal:
[x] how to identify/exploit/remediate the top web security vulnerabilities and arcane bugs.

[x] how to properly handle cryptograph

[x] how to design and review applications from a security standpoint

[x] how to operate as a bug bounty hunter or security consultant

[x] Required tools: Any OS that can run Java apps; web requests with any programming languages; Burp Proxy; Firefox 
### Breaker Mindset:
1. think like a breaker: Understand the app's functionality/why &how it achieve the functionalities, and how to break it.
2. Attacker-defender imbalance: defenders have to find every bug while attackers only need a few. Need to prioritize the findings.
3. Lightweight threat assessment and prioritization: get to know the functionality and think about attacker's goal. Then start Prioritization by ranking areas.
4. How to write good bug reports: for each vulnerability, report needs Title/ Severity/ Description/ Reproduction Steps/ Impact/ Mitigation/ Affected assets
5. Severity: **Informational** (no real impact)/**Low** (business impact is minimal)/**Medium**(Potential to cause harm to users but not revealing data)/**High**(Potential to reveal user data or aids in exploitation of other vulns)/**Critical**(High risk of personal/confidential data exposure, general system compromise and other severe impacts to the business.)
6. Reflected XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) : does not check and limit the input content hence allowing executing a script on webpage.
